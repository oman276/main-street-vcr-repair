A game created by me for the Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam (August 8, 2020)

~~~~

This game was created over one week (August 1st - August 8, 2020) for the Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam. I used C# and Unity.

After taking a month off to participate in the Shad program, I jumped back into game development with a week-long game jam. The 
theme was rewind, and the obvious solution would be to create a game about rewinding time. I wanted to take the theme in a more
unique direction, however, so I made a game themed to an instructional VHS about fixing VCRs that won't rewind tape, filled with
all sorts of typical 80s camp. 

I always try to be more ambitious every time I create a new full game. In my second game, I tried to implement lengthy puzzle 
mechanics, as well as a story fully voiced by me. At first, I experimented with drag and drop puzzles, but it proved too 
complex to be coded, polished, and tested across all mechanics in just a week. Instead, I utilized sliding blocks that would feel 
familiar for players who have played basically any puzzle game.

In addition, I recorded over 60 lines of dialogue by myself, then placed them all into the game to trigger at the proper moments.
This was my first time dealing with narrative and a script, and I think I underestimated how time consuming importing and cataloging 
that audio would be. Thankfully, I got it done in time, and the game turned out very well.

Out of a total of 1,836 entries, this game scored in the top 22% overall, with exceptional scores in game design (top 7%) and audio 
(top 2%). All art, sound, dialogue, and code were created by me.
